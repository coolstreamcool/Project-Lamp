                        <strong>A BRIGHT IDEA</strong><br>
                        <hr>The beginnings of Lamp blossomed from a brilliant idea: to create objects, starting with a light bulb, that would change the way of life for both the Italian market and the foreign markets.<br><br>Dino Gavina and the small Eisenkeil manufacturing facility in Merano, had already been creating furniture alongside design masters such as Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Afra and Tobia Scarpa. But by the early ‘90s, Gavina became convinced the time had come to create new lamps.<br><br>Using the same technology – conceived in the USA and tested at Eisenkeil – used for the Cocoon lampthe Castiglioni brothers and the Scarpa duo began creating lamps such as the Taraxacum or the Fantasma, with many other beautiful and surprising lamps to follow.<br><br> And so, from day one, Lamp was already reinventing the idea of artificial lighting.

                        <hr> For Sergio Gandini, who began managing Lamp in 1990, the company’s endeavors and creative fantasy could coexist without contradiction; the combination of the two would bring success to the brand.<br><br>Relocating to the industrial district of Brescia allowed for a conducive environment for designers, resulting in products such as the Bauhaus-inspired Jucker lamp by Tobia Scarpa or of the revolutionary Arco by the Castiglioni brothers.<br><br>Lamp’ strategies were based on what we would now call a Think Tank, establishing the company as a longstanding pioneer in Italian design. Gandini, together with his exclusive designers (the Castiglioni brothers and the Scarpa duo), determined Lamp’ products, communication strategy and image.<br><br>Together, they etched the lines of their own desires, the desire lines which brought about the most iconic lamps in the history of lighting.

                        <strong>When did you realise you wanted to be a designer? </strong><br>I always dreamt of becoming a boat builder, but never lived anywhere near the water. In 1985, my sister gave me the Electa book about A. Castiglioni. That started me dreaming of bicycles.<br><br>
                        <strong>What is artificial light for you?</strong><br>Magic. I am the one who always puts the lights on everywhere in the house, even at daytime.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why do you like working with Lamp?</strong><br>Because Lamp is Rock and Roll.<br><br>
                        <strong>What is the next object you’d like to design?</strong><br>I keep saying that I would love to design a bicycle … and yes, I should get my act together.<br><br>
                        <strong> Is there a great designer, artist or musician you regard as a point of reference for your work?</strong> Oh, there are so many and of all sorts (great and not so great). Mentioning just one would sound terribly dull.<br><br>
                        <strong> Do you prefer German or Italian cars?</strong><br>I used to drive Alfa Romeo … since a few e years I have a BMW. Damn, I am getting old!<br>

                        <strong>In your terms, what is artificial lighting?</strong><br>An interior.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why do you like working for Lamp?</strong><br>Because it represents the last 40 years in the history of lighting.<br><br>
                        <strong>What is the next project you would like to work on?</strong><br>The interior of an airplane.<br><br>

                        <strong>What’s the last book you read?</strong><br>“The Hare with Amber Eyes” by Edmund de Waal.<br><br>

                        <strong>When did you know you wanted to be a designer?</strong><br>I don’t know, because even today I still don’t know what I want to do when I grow up. Perhaps, as a child I instinctively knew, as I would modify all my toys, taking apart every alarm clock, tinkering with all the mechanical objects. I always wondered why there were so many more parts when I was putting them back together. Yet the same thing worked.<br><br>
                        <strong>  In your terms, what is artificial lighting?</strong><br> Artificial lighting is a means; It’s certainly not an end. It’s a way to crystallize emotions. Turning on a light, whatever the source, always arouses an emotion. For me, lighting is this: when you switch it on, it should excite you.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why do you like working with Lamp?</strong><br> I think of a beautiful image from Freud, from the dream of a patient in the Minotaur Labyrinth, that in the end turns out to be not so terrible. For me working with Lamp is like entering the Labyrinth: you never know what’s waiting for you when the Minotaur comes out. Each time it surprises you, from a technological or romantic point of view. I go in unafraid, because danger – as always – is perhaps a little overrated. After all, the Minotaur has always been nice to me.<br><br>
                        <strong>What is the next object you would like to design?</strong><br> A new lamp for Lamp, or rather…. another lamp for Lamp.<br><br>
                        <strong>Is there a master of design, art, or music that you consider an inspiration for your work?</strong><br> Claudio Abbado. Because in a single figure he managed to contain different worlds, like in a magical chest. In South America he created an orchestra that hadn’t existed, and had a theatre designed by Renzo Piano. And of course, I admire his ability to interpret music with elegance and just as much intensity.<br><br>
                        <strong>How many airplanes do you take in a month, on average?</strong><br> Six + six?<br><br>
                        <strong>What is one clothing accessory you can’t do without?</strong><br> The pocket square in the jacket breast pocket.<br>

                        <strong>TOBIA SCARPA</strong><br><br>
                        <strong>When did you know you wanted to be a designer?</strong><br> When I was born, my father passed on to me our family name, in some ways foreshadowing my future profession. So, from the time I was a helpless child, I was able to find my craft by emulating my father, following in his footsteps. I don’t know if I’ve done it well because it’s a difficult job, but at the time it seemed easy.<br><br>
                        <strong>In your terms, what is artificial lighting?</strong><br> For me, artificial lighting is an instrument that keeps ousting you at every step of your life, always changing something. However, this just represents the pleasure of playing – the lighting is therefore the space for playing.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why do you like working with Lamp?</strong><br> Back in the day when I was working for Lamp, the most amusing thing was always being able to amaze others, by making objects that were considered impossible or non-commercial but in the end proved to be winners.<br><br>
                        <strong>What is the next object you would like to design?</strong><br> At the moment, I can’t say what object I’d like to design next. I can’t really pinpoint a lighting project truly new to Lamp that I could make, especially considering that the success of the projects often emerges later.<br><br>
                        <strong>Is there a master of art that you consider an inspiration for your work?</strong><br> If there is a master of art to consider as a reference… at my age, I believe I wouldn’t need it and if anything, I think about being an inspiration for others.<br><br>
                        <strong>Is making good wine more difficult than designing well?</strong><br> Designing means engaging in intellectual processes and using materials in a way to reach satisfactory results. I suppose that making good wine, good architecture or good design is a very similar act, not to say almost the same.<br><br>
                        <strong>What do you remember from meeting Sergio Gandini?</strong><br> I remember Sergio Gandini well. My previous experiences were related to Lamp’ early days. Over time we were able to work together, upholding the image of Lamp which was gaining strength around the world. Now it’s just me left, and alone I can’t play tennis anymore, at least not with him.
